    <h1>Batman</h1>
    <img src="img/batman-image.jpg" alt="Batman looking over a building that burned down"/>
    <p>Batman is a crime fighting vigilante in Gotham City. His true identity is billionare playboy Bruce Wayne 
        who witnessed the murder of his parents as a child. He became Batman after swearing vengeance against 
        criminals and to protect the innocent. Several movies and series have been made depicting Batman such 
        as <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight">The Dark Knight</a></cite> which is
        considered to be one of the greatest films of all time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>One thing I admire about Batman is his method of defeating criminals. He has no superpowers and 
            must rely on his strategy and intelligence to defeat them.</li>
        <li>Another thing I admire is his purpose. He chose to protect the innocent and bring justice to those 
            who have suffered a crime.</li>
        <li class="highlighted">The last thing I admire is that anyone can be Batman. He is the most realistic 
            superhero and anyone who chooses to do the right thing can be him.</li>
    </ul>
